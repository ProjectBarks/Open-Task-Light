# Writing callouts

Callouts are written as a numbered list nested inside the photo's `<figure>`. The build turns each
item into a dot on the part, a thin leader to a label, and a hover card, and colours the phrase in the
nearby text that names the part. Without the script the list simply reads as a legend under the photo.

    <figure>
    <img src="/images/d37054a9f628.png" alt="CAD view of the electronics housing showing the three button positions">
    <ol class="callouts">
    <li dot="32,50" label="16,26" qty="Insert 1st" link="Part page: self-sourcing-guide/additional-printed-parts/capacitive-power-button">Power button <note>The large round capacitive button. Goes in first.</note></li>
    <li dot="50,41" label="42,14" qty="Insert 2nd" match="minus button" link="Part page: self-sourcing-guide/additional-printed-parts/decrease-brightness-button">Minus button (dim) <note>The square button nearest the power button.</note></li>
    </ol>
    </figure>

One `<li>` per callout. The item's text is the part name; it is also the hover card's title and the
key that gives the part its colour everywhere in the guide, so use the BOM's wording and keep
quantities out of it.

- `dot="x,y"` is where the dot sits, on the part, in percent of the image (0–100, left/top origin).
- `label="x,y"` is where the label pill sits. Put it on clear background near the part, not on top of
  another part or label. The leader line is drawn for you.
- `qty="…"` a count or an ordinal such as `4` or `Insert 1st`. Optional.
- `match="…"` the phrase in the surrounding text to colour. Defaults to the part name. The phrase is
  matched whole-word, case-insensitive, in the text between the previous photo, heading, rule, step or tab
  boundary and this photo (the heading's own words count too), then in the text after it up to the next one. Photos in a
  `<div>` row share one window. Phrases inside links or code blocks never count, and a phrase split by bold, a link or a line break in the source (`power **track**`) is not found. Each occurrence of a phrase highlights
  for one callout only, earlier photos first, so when two photos share the text between them, give the
  second one its own phrase or accept that it has no highlight. The build lists callouts without a
  highlight in `.build/unpaired.txt`.
- `link="Text: path"` a link on the card; repeat with `;` for several (`link="Part page: printing-guide/electronics-housing/shade; BOM: self-sourcing-guide/bill-of-materials"`).
  `path` is a site path from pages.json, or a full URL. Optional.
- `<note>…</note>` inside the item is the card's one- or two-sentence detail. Optional.
- Put the photo's description in the `<img alt="…">`. An optional `<figcaption>…</figcaption>` after the
  `<img>` renders as a caption under the photo.

Keep no blank lines inside a `<figure>` or between the figures of a `<div>` row, or the markdown
parser will split the block.

What deserves callouts: photos where a reader has to identify a part, a bag, a screw size, an
orientation, or a position. Skip progress shots of hands where the text already says everything.
Two to six callouts per image. A part gets a callout the first time it appears in a section and again
only when a later photo shows a new placement, orientation or hardware detail the text relies on.
Dots never sit on a symbol, a mounting hole or a screw head the reader needs to see; move them to the
part's edge.

Placement workflow: `python3 tools/grid.py public/images/<name>.jpg` and view the gridded preview to
read percentages, edit the list, then `python3 tools/preview.py content/<page>.md` and view
`.build/previews/<page-with-slashes-as-__>-<n>.jpg` to confirm dots land on the parts and labels don't collide.

Colours: `part-colors.json` pins parts to named colours; everything else is assigned by the build so
parts sharing a photo never share a colour. `.build/part-colors.generated.json` shows the result.
