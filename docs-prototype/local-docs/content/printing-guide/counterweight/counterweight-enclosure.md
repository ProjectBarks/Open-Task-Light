# Counterweight Enclosure

Enclosure for the counterweight material.

Choose one of the two options for your counterweight enclosure. The default option is the `Steel` variant. The lead variant is an optional upgrade for those who want source lead weight material and achieve a slimmer counterweight.

**Latest versions**

**Steel:** `counterweight-enclosure-steel_v1.1`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Requires pause for [hardware insertion](#hardware-insertion)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" icon="gear" %}
**Settings Overrides:**

Start with the [default print settings](/open-task-light/printing-guide.md#default-print-settings), then apply the changes below.

**Infill:** 75% 3D Honeycomb

**Shells:** 6 perimeters, 6 top layers, 6 bottom layers

**Thick Bridges:** Enabled

**Support style:** Snug or tree/organic
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notes:** Parts like this sometimes want to warp and lift up at the corners. To prevent this when printing with PLA use a smooth PEI sheet. I get best results when I bump up the default PLA bed temperature from 60 to 70.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Before adding weight material, squeeze and lightly twist the enclosure. The wall layers shouldn't separate. If they do, reprint it before filling.

### Orientation

Lay the long flat face on the print surface. You'll likely need to rotate 45° on the Z plane to fit on medium-sized beds such as the Prusa MK3/MK4.

Orient the model so that the belt clip slot is near the front of the printer for easier hardware insertion.

</ol>
</figure>

### Supports

Set support generation to `On build plate only`

Support style: `Grid(snug) or tree/organic`

Add custom support enforcers in the top opening as shown. Don't add an enforcer within the top slot.

</ol>

### Hardware Insertion

Pause for hardware insertion in three places (actual layer number is slicer dependent). Insert the pause on the layer before the slots are capped off. If these layer numbers are way off, double check that `Thick bridges` is enabled.
