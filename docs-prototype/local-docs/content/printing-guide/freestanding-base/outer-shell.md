### Orientation

Bottom (open side) on build plate

<ol class="callouts">
<li dot="45,63" label="45,88">Bottom (open side) <note>The open underside sits flat on the build plate. All of the support material grows up inside it.</note></li>
</ol>
</figure>

### Supports

{% hint style="info" icon="sparkle" %}
This would be a great time to flex your printer's [multi-material capabilities](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/combining-materials-xl_498103) for easier support removal or even dissolvable supports.
{% endhint %}

Set automatic support generation to `On build plate only` .

#### Paint Support Enforcers <a href="#paint-support-blockers" id="paint-support-blockers"></a>

Use the support brush in "fill" mode to paint support enforcers on the faces outlined below (six faces total).

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
Paint enforcers on the two interior rings

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Paint two more enforcers on the recessed lip in the outer channels.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Add two final enforcers on the bottom faces of these two cylinders.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
With all six faces painted your support enforcers should look like this:

<ol class="callouts">
<li dot="30,50" label="52,46" qty="2 faces" match="interior rings">Interior ring <note>The two stepped rings around the centre bore, painted in step 1.</note></li>
<li dot="19,41" label="11,12" qty="2 faces" match="channel lips">Channel lip <note>The thin recessed ledge in each outer channel, one on the left and one on the right. Painted in step 2.</note></li>
<li dot="58,18" label="80,6" qty="2 faces" match="cylinders">Cylinder <note>The bottom face of each screw boss, one at the top and one at the bottom of this view. Painted in step 3.</note></li>
</ol>
</figure>
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

With the support enforcers in place, set the support style to `Snug`.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notes:** Sorry about the excessive support material on this one. I know it's a long print but it's by far the toughest one so it's smooth sailing after this!
{% endhint %}

### Support Material Removal

There's quite a bit here but you should be able to remove it all cleanly in under \~5 minutes with these tips. **Flush cut trimmers are perfect for this job.**

Start by removing what you can with your fingers. You should be able to remove all of the material from the outer channel and the first centimeter or so from the interior.

<figure>

<ol class="callouts">
<li dot="62,27" label="55,10">Outer channel <note>All of the support in this ring should come out by hand.</note></li>
<li dot="50,42" label="22,20">Interior <note>Only the first centimetre or so comes out by hand. The dense material below needs trimmers.</note></li>
</ol>
</figure>

Use flush cut trimmers or small pliers to pull out the dense support material inside.

Once you get down to the thick interface layer, slip your flush cut trimmers between the support material and the part.

Slide the trimmers along the surface to cleanly remove the interface layer.

<figure><img src="/images/932b809acee7.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Remove the interface layer from both interior surfaces, leaving just the small bits and strands.

<figure><img src="/images/9c7eca84cb00.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Lay the sharp end of your trimmers against the surface with the jaws slightly open, then slide them along to shave off the remaining filament.

Don't be afraid to scuff these hidden surfaces—smooth and ugly is better than pristine and rough!

Shave off any remaining bumps.

Clean up the outer channels the same way.

Run your finger over both inner surfaces and the outer channels. Remove any remaining bumps so everything feels flat.
